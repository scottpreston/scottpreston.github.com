Today I created a few repositories.

* Hello JQuery - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-jquery](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-jquery)
* Hello Angular1 - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular1](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular1)
* Hello Angular2 - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular2](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular2)
* Hello Ember - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-ember](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-ember)
* Hello React - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-react](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-react)
* Hello Redux - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-redux](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-redux)

I created these because I've found "Hello World" documentation in the JS Community to be really, really bad.

I will add to these as I experiment with more frameworks. Enjoy!
