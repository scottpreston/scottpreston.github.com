I've updated some repositories and created a few new ones.

Of the ones I've updated, they are essentially obsolete. I've left the old code in the 'old' 
branch of those repositories but I've added a few newer ones to keep pace with the times.

* Hello React Webpack(2) - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-react-webpack](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-react-webpack)
* Hello React (Redux) - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-redux](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-redux)

In addition to those, here are some others previously created that are still relevant:

* Hello JQuery - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-jquery](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-jquery)
* Hello Angular1 - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular)
* Hello Angular2 (TypeScript) - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular2-ts](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-angular2-ts)
* Hello Ember2 - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-ember2](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-ember2)
* Hello VueJS - [https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-vue](https://github.com/scottpreston/hello-vue)

Enjoy!
