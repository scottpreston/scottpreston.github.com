I've updated some repositories:

All of my hello projects I've removed. I've put them in the following repo:

* JS Examples - [https://github.com/scottpreston/js-examples](https://github.com/scottpreston/js-examples)

Fortunately these examples were just used for my personal use, to reference via talks, etc. 

I'm sorry if moving this has inconvienced you.
